# libbex

# current status: started working at the specificiations.

A libbex (from library-index; plural libbices) is a format (I hope it becomes a standard) to communicate a list of packages. It puts as special focus on mid-level-security applications.

## Why do we need a libbex standard?
Any good package manager encourages people to create smaller packages. 
This leads to follow up problems. E.g.:
  * Reviewing dependend packages for any project becomes impossible.
